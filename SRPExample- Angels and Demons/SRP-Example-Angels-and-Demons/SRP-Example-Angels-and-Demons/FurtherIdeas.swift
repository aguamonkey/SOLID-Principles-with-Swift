 Further improvements to the SRP principle: (Truths and Sins)  The current implementation of the "Angels and Demons" app already provides a solid demonstration of the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). However, there are always opportunities to enhance an application, both in terms of functionality and the demonstration of SRP. Here are some suggestions:
 1. Advanced Hierarchy Management
 * Implement more complex hierarchy logic in AngelHierarchy and DemonHierarchy classes. For example, you could introduce methods to sort angels and demons by power levels or other criteria. This would highlight how each model class manages specific logic related to its entity.
 2. Data Persistence
 * Introduce a data persistence layer. You could use Core Data, UserDefaults, or a simple file-based system to persist the list of angels and demons. This would involve creating a new class responsible solely for data storage and retrieval, further emphasizing SRP.
 3. User Customization
 * Allow users to add or edit details of angels and demons. This would require new views and logic for user input, validation, and updating the data model, each with its distinct responsibility.
 4. Asynchronous Data Loading
 * If you're fetching data from a remote source or database, implement asynchronous data loading with loading indicators. This could involve a data service class responsible for asynchronous operations, demonstrating SRP in handling complex data fetching and state management.
 5. Theming and UI Configuration
 * Develop a separate component or service for UI theming or configuration, which could be responsible for defining colors, fonts, and other UI properties. This service would be used across the app to ensure consistent styling while adhering to SRP.
 6. Testing
 * Introduce unit tests for each component of your application. This ensures that each part of your codebase (models, views, services) can be tested independently, in line with SRP.
 7. Refactoring for Reusability
 * Refactor common UI components or utilities into reusable components. For example, if you have similar styles or layouts repeating in different views, you can create a separate view or a modifier that encapsulates this commonality.
 8. Accessibility and Localization
 * Add an accessibility and localization layer. This involves creating specific components or services to handle different languages, text sizes, and accessibility features, adhering to SRP by separating these concerns from the main functionality of the app.
 Each of these enhancements not only improves the functionality and user experience of your app but also serves as an additional demonstration of SRP, by segregating various functionalities into distinct, single-responsibility components.
