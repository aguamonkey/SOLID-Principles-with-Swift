SOLID Principles with Swift

// Will update with the details of each projects story as the code follows suit.

Overview
This repository is dedicated to demonstrating the SOLID principles in the context of Swift and SwiftUI programming. Each principle is explored through a series of SwiftUI projects, clearly annotated to highlight their practical application and benefits. Our aim is to provide a hands-on learning experience for developers who wish to deepen their understanding of SOLID principles in Swift development.

Principles
The SOLID principles are a set of design guidelines in object-oriented programming that enable more understandable, flexible, and maintainable software. We'll explore each principle as follows:

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Project: SRPExample
Description: This project illustrates SRP by creating a SwiftUI view that focuses on a single functionality, ensuring that each class has only one reason to change.
Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

Project: OCPExample
Description: Demonstrates OCP using SwiftUI components that are open for extension but closed for modification, promoting reusable and maintainable code.
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Project: LSPExample
Description: Showcases LSP by implementing interchangeable subclasses that don't alter the expected behavior of the program.
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

Project: ISPExample
Description: Focuses on ISP by designing small and specific protocols for SwiftUI components, ensuring that the implementing classes only need to know about relevant methods.
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

Project: DIPExample
Description: Illustrates DIP in SwiftUI by creating high-level modules independent from low-level modules, using abstractions to achieve decoupling.
Getting Started
To get started with the projects:

Clone the repository.
Navigate to the project directory of the principle you want to explore.
Open the project in Xcode.
Review the source code and comments to understand the application of the SOLID principle.
Run the project in the simulator to see the principle in action.
Contribution
Contributions to enhance the examples or to add additional SwiftUI examples demonstrating the SOLID principles are welcome. Please adhere to the following guidelines:

Ensure that any contributions are clear and concise.
Comments and documentation should be detailed enough to explain the application of the SOLID principle.
Keep the SwiftUI views simple and focused on demonstrating the principle.
