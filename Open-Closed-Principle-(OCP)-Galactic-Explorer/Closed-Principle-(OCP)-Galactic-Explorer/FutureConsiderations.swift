 Here's a list of possible future enhancements:

 1. Real-Time Data Integration
 Integrate real-time astronomical data from APIs like NASA's open APIs.
 Implement a new class or service for API communication, allowing for new data sources to be added without modifying existing data handling.
 2. Interactive 3D Visualization
 Add a feature for 3D visualization of space entities using technologies like SceneKit or RealityKit.
 Develop a separate module for rendering these visualizations, which can be extended with new visual features or entities.
 3. User-Generated Content
 Allow users to add their own space entities or observations.
 Create a separate subsystem for user input, validation, and integration into the existing data model.
 4. Advanced Search and Filtering
 Implement advanced search and filtering capabilities to explore space entities based on various criteria.
 Design a flexible search system that can be extended with new filters and search parameters.
 5. Augmented Reality (AR) Features
 Introduce AR experiences, like viewing planets or constellations in AR.
 Add a new AR module to handle these features, keeping it decoupled from the main application logic.
 6. Community and Social Features
 Add features for users to share their discoveries, join discussions, and collaborate.
 These features should be modular and extendable, enabling the addition of new social elements without impacting existing functionalities.
 7. Gamification and Educational Content
 Incorporate gamification elements, like missions or quizzes, to make learning about astronomy more engaging.
 Develop a separate gamification system to manage these aspects without affecting the core application.
 8. Offline Access and Data Caching
 Implement offline access to key features and data caching for better performance.
 Create a caching mechanism that can be extended to support new data types or caching strategies.
 9. Customizable User Preferences
 Provide options for users to customize settings like themes, data display preferences, and notifications.
 Build a flexible preferences system that can accommodate new settings and features.
 10. Scalable Architecture for New Entity Types
 Ensure the architecture can scale to include new types of astronomical entities or phenomena as our understanding of space evolves.
 This involves designing the system in a way that new entity types can be added with minimal impact on existing code.
 Each of these enhancements should be designed to adhere to OCP by allowing extensions and additions without necessitating changes to the existing, stable code. This approach ensures that the app remains flexible, maintainable, and scalable as it evolves to meet user needs and incorporate new discoveries and technologies.
